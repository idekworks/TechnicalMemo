# atcoder
フィボナッチ数列のあまり計算。

掛け算の途中であまりを計算し、計算量を削減

# kaggle
play groundの時系列解析のデータをやることに、Rも少しは勉強したい。

# 統計
中心極限定理。

# python algo
```python
#1729 = Ta(2) = 1**3 + 12**3 = 9**3 + 10**3
# input 1, 2 => [(1729, [(1, 12), (9, 10)])]
# input 2, 2 => [(1729, [(1, 12), (9, 10)]), (4104, [(2, 16), (9, 15)])]

計算量が多くなるので短縮のために途中から計算できるように第三引数を用意

Today is vote day of sangiiin.

I want to win the team that think about childlen but result is not.

Young people doesn't go to vote latley.

Today was the day to vote in the House of Councillors election.

I had hoped that the party that put children first would win, but that did not happen.

Young people don't go to elections these days.
