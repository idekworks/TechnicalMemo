カエルの階段問題。動的計画法python実装。

```c
N = int(input())
h = list(map(int, input().split()))
dp = [1<<30] * N
dp[0] = 0
dp[1] = abs(h[0] - h[1])
for n in range(2, N):
    tmp1 = dp[n - 1] + abs(h[n - 1] - h[n])
    tmp2 = dp[n - 2] + abs(h[n - 2] - h[n])
    dp[n] = min(tmp1, tmp2)
print(dp[N - 1])

I couldn't play the game today.

I have not been able to complete my morning study routine lately due to oversleeping.

I need to get up early, I have a lot of work to do and I am not sure if I will be able to do it today.
